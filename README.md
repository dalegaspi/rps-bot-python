# rps-bot-python
A bot written in a Python for a hackathon in 2013.  A variation of the Rock Paper Scissors game.

In a true hackathon fashion to win at all costs:

- I used the QA on-prem servers to run my bot in addition to running it on my dev machine.
- I used a Man-in-the-Middle attack so other participants will _randomly_ (to avoid suspicion) have their network connections paralyzed so only my bots can access the RPS server.
- I wrote the bot in Python when everyone else played it safe and wrote it in C#.  [I also wrote in Go](https://github.com/dalegaspi/rps-bot-go) but opted to use this version in the actual hackathon instead.
